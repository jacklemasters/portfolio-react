    "bio":"My name is Jackson LeMasters, and I am a graduate of the University of Denverâ€™s Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. Previously, I was a student at University of Northern Colorado working towards a history degree, working part time jobs to get through college. The COVID pandemic changed that plan, and subsequently led me to explore a career in web development. I have worked on a contract position, some freelance gigs, and eventually began working at Trace First as a Junior Software Engineer, utilizing Ruby on Rails and MySQL. I enjoy using Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Bootstrap, and React when coding my projects. However, I also have experience with Node.js, Express.js, HAML/HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Github, MongoDB, TailwindCSS and jQuery. I realize being an experienced web developer encompasses a need for continued learning, and I look forward to the journey ahead. Working professionally, I hope to gain skills that will allow me to utilize my knowledge of programming, while gaining the real-world experience necessary to grow personally and professionally.",
