      "bio":"My name is Jackson LeMasters. I am currently a graduate from the University of Denverâ€™s Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. Previously, I was a student at University of Northern Colorado working toward a history degree, working part time jobs to get through college. COVID changed that plan and subsequently led me to explore a career in web development. While still fairly new to web development, I believe I am a quick learner and I have acquired a passion for building applications and websites. I enjoy using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, however I also have experience with Node.js, Express.js, Git, Github, MySQL, MongoDB, Bootstrap and React. I realize being an experienced web developer encompasses a need for continued learning, and I look forward to the journey ahead. At the end of October, I will have credentials as a Full Stack Developer, and am currently searching for a job that will allow me to utilize my skills, while gaining the real-world experience necessary to grow personally and professionally.",
